"""Drop legacy 'paper' mode aliasing — shadow + live only.

Revision ID: 202604300002
Revises: 202604300001
Create Date: 2026-04-30

Migrates any historical ``mode='paper'`` rows on traders + trader_orders +
copy_trading_configs (and any other table with a ``mode`` column referencing
the trader-execution mode) to ``mode='shadow'``, then installs a CHECK
constraint pinning future writes to ``('shadow', 'live')``.

Backstory: ``paper`` was a legacy alias for ``shadow`` and silently
normalized at multiple read paths (``_normalize_trader_mode``,
``_normalize_mode_key``, ``_LEGACY_MODE_ALIASES``, payload aliases on
``order_manager``).  The dual-naming ate cycles every time someone read
the code; this migration is the boundary that ends it.

Idempotent: the UPDATE is a no-op if no rows have ``mode='paper'``, and
the CHECK constraint creation guards against duplicate installs.
