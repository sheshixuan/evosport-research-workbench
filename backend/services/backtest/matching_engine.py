"""Order-book aware matching engine for the backtester.

This module is the heart of execution-realistic backtesting. Given:

* a stream of L2 snapshots (``BookReplay``),
* a venue model (``Venue`` — currently Polymarket),
* a latency model (``LatencyModel``), and
* a sequence of order intents emitted by a strategy,

it produces a deterministic ledger of fills, partial fills, rejections,
and cancel/replace transitions that mirror the live ``execute_live_order``
→ Polymarket CLOB path as closely as possible without sending traffic to
the venue.

Order lifecycle states
======================

::

    pending_submit → working   → filled | partial → done
                  ↘ rejected       ↓
                                  (cancel | reprice)
                                   ↓
                                  cancelled

* ``pending_submit`` — order intent emitted at strategy time T; will hit
  the venue at T + submit_latency.
* ``working`` — accepted by the venue and resting on the book.
* ``partial`` — has filled some size but not all; remainder still resting
  (only possible for GTC; IOC/FAK/FOK transition straight to done).
* ``filled`` / ``cancelled`` / ``rejected`` — terminal.

The engine is **single-threaded and deterministic**: given identical
inputs (including latency-model seed) it produces identical fills.

# Polymarket fees on a backtest break into three components:

#   1. **Per-fill gas** — every submitted order pays Polygon gas (proxy
#      wallet → CTF Exchange). Default ~$0.005/tx, configurable.
#   2. **Per-fill venue fee** — the CLOB itself charges 0 bps on trades;
#      kept as a parameter for non-Polymarket venues.
#   3. **Resolution fee** — at settlement the venue takes a fraction of
#      the winning side's proceeds (2% on Polymarket). This is *not* a
#      per-fill fee; it is applied by ``portfolio.py`` when a position
#      closes profitably (or settles at $1 / $0).
#
# This module exposes a single ``FeeModel`` that bundles all three, so
# both the matching engine and the portfolio reach for the same source of
# truth. Defaults are Polymarket-correct; pass overrides for other venues.


@dataclass
class FeeModel:
    """Bundled fee model for backtesting.

    Defaults match Polymarket as of 2026:

    * taker fills pay Polymarket's quadratic TAKER fee curve (~1.56% of
      price at p=0.50, tapering to ~0.2% at the tails) via the canonical
      ``utils.kelly.polymarket_taker_fee`` — the SAME curve the strategies
      gate on, so backtest fees match the strategy's own assumptions.
    * ``maker_bps = 0.0`` — Polymarket makers pay no fee
    * ``per_fill_gas_usd = 0.005`` — Polygon proxy-wallet tx cost
    * ``resolution_fee_rate = 0.0`` — Polymarket's cost is the per-fill
      taker fee, not a separate winner/settlement fee; kept as a knob for
      venues that DO charge one (applied on winning proceeds at settlement)
    * ``negrisk_conversion_gas_usd = 0.01`` — additional gas when a
      negative-risk multi-outcome leg requires CTF↔NegRisk conversion
    * ``maker_rebate_bps = 0.0`` — Polymarket-specific liquidity-reward
      approximation.  Real rewards are paid daily as LP tokens
      proportional to time-weighted maker depth inside a configurable
      spread band; modeling that fully requires per-tick time-on-book
      tracking which is too expensive in backtest.  This bps value is a
      conservative per-fill PROXY: enable it to estimate the realised
      maker P&L uplift from rebates, which on top crypto markets has
      historically been worth ~1-3 bps annualised on notional.  Treat
      anything over 5 bps as optimistic — real rebate yield erodes as
      makers compete for the same band.
    * ``maker_rebate_max_spread_bps = 50.0`` — only count maker fills
      whose limit price was within this distance of the snapshot mid
      as eligible for the rebate.  Approximates the actual program's
      "inside the spread band" requirement.

    Pass ``per_fill_gas_usd=0`` to disable gas modeling (unit tests do

# ── Adversarial book impact model ──────────────────────────────────────
#
# The standard backtest assumption is that your order does NOT move the
# book — you fill at the displayed price and other participants don't
# respond.  For tiny orders against deep books that's a reasonable
# approximation.  For institutional-size orders or thin books, it's
# significantly optimistic: real makers lift their quotes when they see
# an aggressive taker walking the book; real takers fade.
#
# This model adds a square-root-impact penalty to taker fills.  The
# penalty represents how much the book would have shifted AWAY from
# the taker over the course of consuming visible depth.  Calibration:
#
#   impact_bps = strength * sqrt(your_notional / total_visible_notional)
#
# where ``strength`` is a per-venue tunable.  Empirical literature on
# equities pins ``strength`` around 0.5-1.0; on prediction markets it
# is likely smaller (binary contracts have natural anchors at 0/1) —
# we default to 0.0 (off) so existing backtests are unchanged, and
# expose ``impact_bps`` as an additive override for the operator.
#
# The model is consulted by the matching engine on each taker fill;
# it adjusts the effective fill price by ``impact_bps`` BPS in the
# adverse direction (BUY pays more, SELL receives less).

    """Almgren-Chriss square-root impact + capacity curve.

    Two-regime response function on the size/depth ratio ``r``:

      * ``r <= capacity_threshold``  →  ``strength_bps * sqrt(r)``
        (textbook Almgren-Chriss; impact grows concavely with size).
      * ``r >  capacity_threshold``  →  the same square-root term at
        the threshold PLUS a superlinear penalty
        ``strength_bps * (r - threshold) ** capacity_exponent``.

    The second regime models capacity decay: real books thin out
    under sustained pressure, late-arriving liquidity is asymmetric
    (other makers pull ahead of you), and sweep orders pay a worse
    blended price than depth-weighted average suggests.  Without this
    term the simulator says a $100k order in a $10k book pays the
    same impact as $1k in a $10k book — patently wrong.

    ``strength_bps`` is the impact (in bps of price) you'd pay if you
    consumed exactly the threshold fraction of visible side depth.
    ``cap_bps`` truncates the worst case so a single sweep can't
    eat infinite impact.

    ``strength_bps = 0`` disables impact entirely (existing backtests
    unchanged until operators opt in).  Calibration starting points:
        * 5-10 bps  — top-of-book on deep crypto markets (BTC/ETH 5m).
        * 25-50 bps — illiquid event markets, thin books, or off-hours.

             depth at the order's own-side level — that's the FIFO
             queue ahead of us.  Each subsequent snapshot's external
             consumption decays that count (see ``advance_to``).  Until
             ``queue_depth_ahead == 0`` we are NOT eligible to fill,
             even if the book "crosses" our price — the cross consumes
             the queue ahead of us, not our own size.

          2. **Cross check.**  Once we're at the front of the queue,
             a cross of the spread (opposing side reaching our price)
             fills us at our limit price.  We fill at most the
             remaining external depth the cross brought (capped by
             our remaining size).

        Without (1), dense delta replay credits every cross-event as
        a full fill against the visible level — multiplying intents
        into 2-3× as many fills as reality would produce.  With (1)
        the math is correct: a resting order at the back of a deep
        queue takes time and consistent flow to fill, just like live.
