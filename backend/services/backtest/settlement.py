"""Golden-source market settlement for the backtester.

A position held into a market's resolution must settle at the binary
outcome — the winning outcome-token redeems at $1.00, the losing token at
$0.00 — NOT at the last observed order-book mid.  For BTC/ETH 5-minute
Up/Down markets, which exist to be held to expiry, that payoff IS the
dominant PnL term, so marking to the last mid (the legacy behavior)
systematically misstates returns.

This module defines the per-token settlement record the engine consumes.
Populating the actual winners is the settlement *store*'s job
(``services.backtest.settlement_store``), which sources outcomes OFFLINE
and reproducibly (no decision-time look-ahead): a winner is only ever
read at/after a position's resolution time, never fed into the strategy's
decision inputs.
