"""Golden-source settlement store: read/populate market resolutions.

Persists per-market resolution truth in the ``market_settlements`` table
(keyed by ``condition_id``) and turns it into the engine's
``token_id -> TokenSettlement`` map.

Population is OFFLINE and write-through:
  * import-time capture of the polybacktest winner (known at import), and
  * the resolution resolver
    (``services.strategy_reverse_engineer.market_resolution``) as a
    backfill for anything not captured at import.

Reads happen at SETTLEMENT time only, so nothing here is ever exposed to a
strategy's decision inputs — no look-ahead.  The store records the winning
TOKEN id (not just an outcome label) so the read path is a direct token-id
equality check, immune to the mislabeled "Yes"/"No" outcome strings that
crypto Up/Down markets carry in the catalog.
