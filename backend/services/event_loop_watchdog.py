"""Asyncio event-loop stall detector.

Runs as a low-overhead background task that periodically schedules a
short ``asyncio.sleep`` and measures how late the wakeup actually
arrives.  If the wakeup is delayed beyond a threshold the loop has
been monopolized by something — either a long sync function on the
loop, a C-extension that didn't release the GIL, or excessive CPU work
inside a coroutine without yielding.

When a stall is detected we dump the active task list with each task's
short stack so operators can see exactly which coroutine was running
when the loop ground to a halt.  That is the single most valuable
diagnostic for "everything just got slow" symptoms in production.

Soft-fail: any exception in the watchdog itself is swallowed.  The
watchdog must NEVER crash the event loop it monitors.
