"""Cox proportional hazards trainer for the fill probability model.

Run nightly by ``workers/cox_trainer_worker.py``.  Reads TraderOrder
fills/cancels/expires together with the book context captured on each
order at placement time (book_age_ms, time_to_resolution, …), fits Cox
PH (or KM fallback if too few events), and
inserts a new row into ``fill_probability_models``.  Promotion to
``active=True`` is a separate decision: only promote when C-index
beats the currently-active model by the configured margin.

Why Cox PH:

* Right-censoring is natural — orders that are still open at training
  time aren't filled-yet but aren't unfilled-forever either.  Cox
  treats them as censored, KM does too.
* Hazard ratios per covariate are interpretable — we can show the
  user "your queue_ahead_shares HR=0.97 per 1k shares" in the UI.
* Inference is just a dot product against learned betas plus a
  baseline-survival-curve lookup, ~microseconds per order.

We use ``lifelines.CoxPHFitter``.  The trainer is conservative:

* Fall back to Kaplan-Meier (no covariates, just baseline S(t)) if
  we have fewer than 100 events total.  KM is still useful — the
  baseline survival curve gives you "P(fill within Δt) under typical
  market conditions" which beats the constant-fill assumption.
* Skip strata with fewer than 50 events when fitting stratified Cox.
* Reject the model if C-index < 0.55 (worse than coin flip after
  factoring in censoring).

Validation is held-out: the most recent 7 days of orders are reserved
for testing; everything older is the training set.  C-index and
integrated Brier score are computed on the held-out cohort.
