"""Learned empirical constants for the fill estimator.

Replaces the hardcoded magic numbers in ExecutionEstimatorConfig
(``displayed_depth_factor=0.88``, ``maker_queue_ahead_fraction=0.65``,
etc.) with values estimated from the actual canonical book-delta feed
(``DELTA_SCHEMA`` parquet, via ``marketdata.aggregate_delta_events``).

Each constant has:

* a measurement function that crunches canonical delta parquet / fill events
* a 5-minute in-process cache so the order hot path doesn't re-scan parquet
* a fallback to the current default if no data is available yet

These constants are *additionally* exposed in the UI under
``Strategies → ML Models → Fill Model``, so an operator can override
any of them.  The override takes priority over the measured value;
setting the override to None reverts to "use measured".

    The math is a pragmatic first cut — empirically validate further
    once we have real data flowing through it:

    * **displayed_depth_factor**: across all trade events, what
      fraction of the queue_depth_before was actually traded vs
      remained as displayed-but-not-traded?  Empirical visible-
      liquidity ratio.
    * **stale_depth_decay**: the same ratio computed on cancel
      events — how much of a level "decays" purely from cancellation
      pressure when stale.
    * **maker_queue_ahead_fraction**: assumed prior on where in the
      same-level queue you sit.  Computed as the median fraction of
      same-level depth that cleared before each level was depleted.
      No clean closed-form yet — we keep the default of 0.65 for V1
      and rely on the Cox covariate ``queue_ahead_shares`` (Phase 2)
      to account for variance.
