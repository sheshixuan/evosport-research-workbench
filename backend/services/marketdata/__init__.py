"""Unified market-data layer.

This package is the single, point-in-time-correct foundation for reading
recorded/imported market data — used by both the backtest engine and (at
``as_of=now``) live strategies, so live and replay share one access path.

Layering (built across phases):

  * ``asof``     — the one point-in-time (<= tau) lookup primitive.
  * ``merge``    — the one ordered k-way merge (sync + async).
  * ``manifest`` — content-hashed DatasetSnapshot for reproducible runs.
  * ``schema``   — the single schema authority (validate on read + write).
  * ``view``     — (Phase 2) ``MarketDataView``: book_at / iter_books /
                   events / coverage, resolving across canonical parquet +
                   the event bus, hiding source selection from callers.

Phase 1 ships the bottom four as pure, independently-tested primitives with
no wiring into the engine yet (no behavior change).
