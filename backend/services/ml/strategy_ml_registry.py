"""Registry that resolves ``task_key`` to an ``MLCapability``.

Two registration paths feed this registry:

1. **Built-in capabilities** — registered via ``register_ml_capability``
   at module-import time.  Used for capabilities that don't have a
   strategy yet (e.g. the migrated ``crypto_directional`` task that
   the platform records passively for any matching market).

2. **Strategy-attached capabilities** — discovered by iterating
   ``strategy_loader.get_all_instances()`` on each lookup.  A
   strategy class can declare ``ml_capability = MLCapability(...)``
   as a class attribute and the registry picks it up automatically.

Resolution precedence on lookup:
- Strategy-attached wins over built-in (lets a strategy override the
  default ``crypto_directional`` capability if it wants stricter
  scope filters or different features).
- Within strategies, first-loaded wins; warn on duplicate task_key.
