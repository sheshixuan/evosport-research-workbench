"""Backtest replay bridge — the seam where the discovery-replay loop
meets the recorded-event bus.

Today's discovery replay (strategy_backtester._replay_discover_opportunities)
hand-loads each event kind from its own SQL table:
  * wallet_trade  → wallet_monitor_events (the one wired kind)
  * everything else → not implemented

The bus is the institutional-grade upgrade: discovery replay says
"give me events for these topics in this window," the bus heap-merges
across storage backends, and the loop dispatches them to the strategy
the same way live does.

This module gives the runner one entry point:

  events = await replay_events_for_strategy(
      strategy=strategy,
      slug=slug,
      start_dt=..., end_dt=...,
      entity_filter=...,  # per-topic asset/wallet/token filter
  )

It resolves the strategy's declared subscriptions to bus topics
(via the compat shim in batch G), pulls envelopes from the bus,
and projects them back to the legacy event shape every discovery
replay codepath already understands.  That projection is what lets
the bus light up incrementally — strategies subscribe to topics,
the bridge takes care of "what shape does the existing
event_dispatcher hand them in live?"  Backtest delivery matches live.
