"""Parquet writer + reader for bus-native topics.

The parquet backend is the default storage for new topics — cheap to
keep years of history, fast to scan (window, topic) ranges, easy to
back up.  Layout on disk:

    {storage_uri}/                         # configured per topic in catalog
      {entity_id}/                         # token_id, asset_id, wallet, etc.
        {YYYY-MM-DD}/                      # date partition
          events__{batch_id}.parquet

Writes are batched and asynchronous.  The publish hot path enqueues
into an in-memory ring; a background task flushes full
(``_FLUSH_BATCH_SIZE``) batches every ``_FLUSH_INTERVAL_SECONDS``, and
additionally drains PARTIAL (sub-batch) buckets every
``_PARTIAL_FLUSH_INTERVAL_SECONDS`` so LOW-VOLUME topics are durable too
(without it they would never reach a full batch and would only flush on
graceful shutdown).  This trades a tiny window of crash-vulnerability (the
in-memory ring before flush) for hot-path throughput — the same trade-off
the existing :mod:`services.market_data_ingestor` makes for snapshots /
deltas.  Operators who want durability over throughput can lower the flush
intervals toward 0 (per-event flush) at the cost of one parquet write per
envelope.

File-level schema:

    topic            string
    entity_id        string
    observed_at_us   int64
    ingested_at_us   int64
    source           string
    sequence         int64 (nullable)
    schema_version   int32
    payload_json     string   -- compact JSON; topic-specific shape

Why JSON for payload rather than per-topic columnar layouts:

  * Payload shapes evolve.  Locking each topic into a fixed
    parquet schema would mean a migration on every payload bump.
  * Replay reads the envelope on every row regardless of payload
    use, so the payload deserialisation is amortised against the
    iteration cost.
  * The system's hottest topic (polymarket.book.snapshot) is NOT
    backed by this writer — its hot path lives in the existing
    market_data_ingestor.  Bus-native topics are the smaller-volume
    ones (crypto.update, news.gdelt, fills, decisions) where JSON
    decode cost is negligible.

Topics whose volume eventually demands columnar payload storage
can opt into a per-topic columnar layout later — the catalog's
``payload_schema_json`` field is the hook.  Out of scope for v1;
the JSON-payload default covers every topic we have today.
