"""Global recording master switch.

A single source of truth for "is market-data recording currently enabled?"
backed by ``app_settings.recording_enabled``.  When the operator flips the
switch off, ALL recording stops writing to disk:

  * the live book/delta ingestor drops its flush batches
    (``services.market_data_ingestor._flush_batch``),
  * the proactive subscription loop unsubscribes and selects no tokens
    (``services.recorder_subscription_service``),
  * the crypto.update.dispatch bus tee is skipped
    (``services.market_runtime._publish_crypto_update_to_bus``).

The flag is read with a short TTL cache so hot-path callers (the ingestor
flush loop runs continuously) don't hit the DB on every batch, yet the
toggle still takes effect within a few seconds — no app restart required.

The setter (``set_recording_enabled``) is what the API handler calls; it
persists to the DB and primes the in-process cache so the change is visible
immediately in whichever process served the request.  Other processes pick
it up within ``_TTL`` seconds via their own refreshes.

# ── Recorder configuration (depth / coverage / capture toggles) ────────────
#
# Operator-tunable recording knobs, persisted as a single JSON blob in
# ``app_settings.recorder_config_json`` so new knobs can be added without a
# schema migration.  Read live with the same short-TTL cache as the master
# switch so hot-path callers (the ingestor's level-truncation, the proactive
# subscription loop) pick up changes within ``_CONFIG_TTL`` seconds without
# hitting the DB on every snapshot / tick.
#
# Defaults encode a BROAD, strategy-independent capture policy so a fresh
# operator records the near-complete active Polymarket universe out of the box
# (a strategy authored later can then be backtested on data that no strategy
# subscribed to at capture time):
#   * depth_levels      -> market_data_ingestor level truncation (25 = full book)
#   * max_tokens        -> 40000 (per clob token; covers the whole active
#                          universe — ~37k tokens, 2 per binary market — w/ headroom)
#   * min_liquidity_usd -> 1.0 (near-floor; excludes only dead / no-book markets)
#   * capture_books / capture_trades / capture_catalog default True.
# The env-var fallbacks in ``recorder_subscription_service`` (_DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS,
# _MIN_LIQUIDITY_USD) are only used if a config read fails mid-tick; the live
# source of truth for coverage is this blob, read each loop tick.

# A touch longer than the master-switch TTL: these knobs change rarely and
# the depth value is read on the per-snapshot hot path.
_CONFIG_TTL = 5.0

_DEPTH_MIN = 1
_DEPTH_MAX = 25

# Authoritative key set + defaults.  Any persisted blob is filtered/merged
# against this so a stray key can never leak into the config and a missing
# key always falls back to the default.
# NOTE on the broad-by-default coverage policy:
#   * ``max_tokens`` = 40000 is the per-CLOB-TOKEN subscription cap (NOT a
#     per-market cap).  Polymarket binary markets carry TWO clob tokens each, so
#     the live active universe of ~18k markets is ~37k tokens (measured via the
#     recorder funnel against the live catalog).  40000 covers the entire active
#     universe today with headroom for growth, while still bounding the single
#     shared WS connection so it can't be asked to track an unbounded set.  A
#     fresh operator therefore records EVERY active market by default; the cap
#     only bites in a catalog-explosion scenario well beyond today's universe.
#   * ``min_liquidity_usd`` = 1.0 is intentionally near the floor.  A market
#     with >= $1 of resting liquidity has a real two-sided book worth recording;
#     genuinely dead / no-book markets report 0 liquidity and are excluded by
#     ``_classify_market`` (no clob token / not accepting orders) and by this
#     floor.  Recording broadly is the whole point: a strategy authored LATER
#     must be backtestable on markets that no strategy subscribed to at capture
#     time, so we capture the near-complete active universe rather than only the
#     liquid head.  Idle tokens self-prune via the 10-min eviction in ws_feeds,
#     so the low floor costs WS bandwidth only while a market is actually moving.
