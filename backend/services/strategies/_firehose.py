"""Crypto strategy firehose — terminal-visible per-gate evaluation events.

The trader Terminal tab only renders events emitted via
``buffer_trader_event``.  Crypto strategies historically silently
``return None`` at each rejection point; this helper makes those
decisions visible to the user, tagged with a verbosity tier so the
volume can be tuned in the UI.

Tiers (lowest → loudest, matched to the UI volume dial):

* ``WHISPER`` — every market evaluated every cycle, even ones that
  fail the cheapest gates (timeframe match, asset list, milestone
  not yet crossed).  Hundreds of events per minute under load.
* ``MURMUR``  — only markets that passed the cheap gates and died
  on a meaningful one (oracle freshness, distance, VWAP, book depth).
* ``VOICE``   — an Opportunity was emitted; passed every gate.
* ``SHOUT``   — orders / executions (used by the execution layer,
  not strategies).
* ``ALARM``   — errors / exceptions; emitted as ``severity="error"``
  and always shown regardless of the user's volume setting.

Firehose events use ``event_type="firehose_gate"`` (single-gate
rejections), ``event_type="firehose_evaluation"`` (full gate-by-gate
summary), and ``event_type="firehose_emit"`` (opportunity emitted).
All carry ``source="crypto"`` so the UI can route them to the Crypto
bot's Terminal tab.

Trader-id is intentionally ``None`` — these events describe global
strategy state, not a specific trader's decision flow.  The UI
matches them to a trader by ``source_key`` + the trader's enabled
strategies.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Strategy-emit eligibility cache
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Pre-fix, every strategy that ran on_event for a tick fired firehose
# evaluation events to the trader-events stream.  That meant:
#   * Strategies loaded but bound to no active trader (e.g. spike_
#     reversion when no trader has it in source_configs) still spammed
#     the Live Pulse feed with rejections.
#   * Events fired even when the orchestrator was disabled.
#   * Per-bot terminals leaked events from strategies the bot doesn't
#     run (because the events carried no trader_id).
#
# This cache resolves all three:
#   * ``_orchestrator_enabled`` → if False, suppress emit entirely.
#   * ``_strategy_to_trader_ids`` → the set of LIVE-mode trader_ids
#     that have ``strategy_slug`` in their ``source_configs``.  If
#     empty, suppress emit (no one consumes this strategy's signals).
#     Otherwise, tag the event payload with the list so per-bot
#     terminals can filter by ``trader_id IN bound_trader_ids``.
#
# TTL is short (3 s) — orchestrator enable / trader-config edits show
# up to firehose within a single refresh.

_BINDING_TTL_SECONDS = 3.0
# Hard ceiling on the cache age before we *must* block to refresh.
# Between TTL_SECONDS and STALE_HARD_SECONDS we serve the stale value
# and kick off a background refresh — that prevents a thundering herd
# of evaluation tasks from queueing behind one DB roundtrip when the
# DB momentarily slows down.  Above the hard ceiling we resume blocking
# behaviour so we never return a wildly outdated binding map.

#
# Pre-fix stall dumps showed x22-x27 concurrent emission tasks parked
# at _refresh_binding_cache_guarded:169 and x27-x54 at _tracked_emission:337.
# Two latent bugs drove the herd:
#
#   1. Race in the soft-stale path: ``if not _binding_refresh_inflight``
#      was a sync read, but the flag was set INSIDE the refresh task
#      (after the await boundary).  N concurrent callers all passed the
#      check and each scheduled its own refresh task — hence the x27
#      copies of _refresh_binding_cache_guarded in stall dumps.
#
#   2. Hard-stale path used ``async with _binding_refresh_lock:``, which
#      serialized N waiters through one DB roundtrip.  27 waiters × one
#      roundtrip queued the whole orchestrator behind the slowest path.
#
# The Future replaces both paths:
#   - Sync assignment (``_binding_refresh_future = loop.create_future()``)
#     claims the refresh slot atomically — concurrent readers either
#     observe the existing future or create one, never both.
#   - All waiters await the SAME future in parallel.  One refresh, N
#     wakeups simultaneously.

# Fix OO — Firehose emission backpressure.
#
# Pre-fix observation: stall dumps showed 1000+ tasks parked at
# ``_firehose.py:emit_evaluation:327`` and ``emit_emit:391``.  Every
# crypto_update tick, six strategies each emit several gate/eval/emit
# events per market they consider — easily 300-600 fire-and-forget
# tasks per second.  When the binding cache refresh blocked on a slow
# DB query (or audit-write Redis publish hiccupped), tasks accumulated
# faster than they drained, saturating the event loop and pushing
# orchestrator cycles to 30-90 s.
#
# Firehose events are observability, not load-bearing.  Drop them
# under pressure rather than letting them gum up the event loop.  The
# budget below is generous enough to never bite during normal

# Under load each emit coroutine awaits ``buffer_trader_event`` which
# takes the hot_state ``_audit_lock``.  Watchdog dumps from the post-R8
# soak showed ``_firehose.py:_tracked_emission:390 x29`` in multiple
# stall windows — 29 concurrent emission tasks all parked on the same
# lock, contending with the audit flusher.  The old in-flight budget
# (256) was orders of magnitude too loose to catch this.
#
# This replaces the per-emit Task with a bounded asyncio.Queue and ONE
# long-running pump task that drains it sequentially.  Only one task
# ever contends for ``_audit_lock``; callers still return synchronously
# because ``Queue.put_nowait`` is sync.  Queue-full drops give us the
