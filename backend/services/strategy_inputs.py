"""Canonical reconstructors for the inputs a strategy's
``detect(events, markets, prices)`` receives.

Today this module owns the ONE faithful ``dict -> Market`` / ``dict -> Event``
rehydration used when replaying recorded or projected market snapshots, so the
backtest stops carrying divergent reconstructors.

This module also owns the canonical ``DataEvent`` builders
(:func:`build_market_data_refresh_inputs` / :func:`build_crypto_update_inputs`)
that the LIVE scanner + crypto dispatch and the backtest projection construct
their events through, so a strategy's ``(events, markets, prices)`` are wired in
ONE place across live and backtest.  (The backtest's recorded-event-bus replay
sites are deliberately NOT routed through these builders — they reconstruct from
a recorded envelope whose payload is *already* in the builder's canonical shape,
because the live producer used the builder when it recorded it; re-imposing the
builder there would only risk byte drift.)

Note on the THIRD dict->Market path: the live crypto path uses
``btc_eth_convergence._market_from_crypto_dict`` for crypto-worker dicts
(``up_price``/``down_price``/``end_time``).  It is intentionally NOT folded into
``hydrate_market``: the backtest now dispatches crypto strategies through their
own ``on_event`` (the live entry point), so that reconstructor runs identically
live and in backtest — a private live-path detail, no longer a
backtest-vs-live divergence.

Dependency-light on purpose (imports only ``models.market`` + stdlib; the
``services.data_events`` import is lazy, inside the builders) so scanner /
backtester / projection can all import it without the existing circular-import
dance.
