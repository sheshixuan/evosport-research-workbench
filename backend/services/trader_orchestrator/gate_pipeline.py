"""Phase 2 of the gate-pipeline refactor: formal Gate + Pipeline protocol.

Every gate in the orchestrator (platform, venue, and — in Phase 3 —
strategy SDK) is represented as a first-class :class:`Gate` instance with
a declared :class:`CostClass`.  The :class:`GatePipeline` runs gates in
ascending cost-class order (stable within a class) and short-circuits on
the first ``passed=False`` result.

Why this matters
----------------
Before Phase 1, every signal paid the 5-13s placeholder DB write cost
even when the venue's collateral or spread gate would reject it post-DB.
Phase 1 hoisted those checks pre-DB but kept them as inline code in
``session_engine.pre_db_venue_preflight``.  Phase 2 generalizes the same
pattern: every gate declares its cost class, and the pipeline guarantees
the cheap gates run first.  Phase 4 will hook per-gate latency telemetry
into the orchestrator's slow-log.

No external deps — pure stdlib so the module sits cleanly inside the
trader_orchestrator package with no import cycles.

    time monotonic-clock read).  ``snapshot()`` computes percentiles
    from the rolling window on demand — callers pay the percentile cost,
    not the hot path.

    Thread-safety
    -------------
    The backing dict and per-gate deque are updated from a single
    asyncio loop in the trader orchestrator process, so no lock is
    needed.  If we ever go multi-threaded, the dict mutation in
    ``_get_or_create`` and the deque append in ``record`` become
    hazardous — add a :class:`threading.Lock` at that point.  Reading
    via ``snapshot()`` from a different thread is best-effort: it may
    see slightly-stale data but cannot corrupt structures because each
    aggregator is read field-by-field.

    Memory bound
    ------------
    ``window_size`` per gate, each a float (~28B on CPython).  At 256
    samples per gate, a gate uses ~7KB.  Even 1000 distinct gates would
    fit in under 10MB.

    Auto-demotion
    -------------
    ``auto_demote`` is opt-in via constructor flag.  When ``True`` and
    a gate's observed p95 (over the last
    :data:`_BUDGET_VIOLATION_LOOKBACK` samples) exceeds its declared
    ``latency_budget_ms`` by :data:`_BUDGET_VIOLATION_RATIO`x, the gate
    is marked ``auto_demoted=True`` in subsequent snapshots and a
    structured warning is logged (rate-limited to once per gate per
    :data:`_BUDGET_VIOLATION_LOG_INTERVAL_SECONDS`).  Phase 4 LOGS the
    violation but does not actually move the gate to a slower cost
    class — that's a behavioral change the next phase will ship behind
    a separate flag once we trust the detection.
