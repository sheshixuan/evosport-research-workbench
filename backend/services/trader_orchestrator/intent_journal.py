"""Local append-only intent journal for the fast-tier order hot path.

Why this exists
---------------
The fast crypto submit path must answer one question durably *before* it
touches the venue: "have I already fired this signal?".  The venue gives
us no help — Polymarket's CLOB does not dedup by our ``metadata`` key
(see ``intent_journal`` discovery note in ``fast_idempotency``) and FAK
market orders carry no stable nonce, so the venue will happily accept a
duplicate submission after a crash-restart.  Something on our side must
record the intent durably ahead of the wire.

Previously that durable record was a synchronous Postgres commit of a
``placing`` skeleton ``TraderOrder`` row (``fast_submit`` pre-fix).  A
networked RDBMS commit on the order critical path is the wrong tool: even
with ``synchronous_commit=local`` it is a backend round-trip whose tail
spiked to multiple seconds under pool contention (see the soak captures
referenced in ``config.py``).  The institutional pattern is journal-first:
append the intent to a local append-only log with an ``fsync`` (tens of
microseconds on local NVMe), act, and treat the database as an
asynchronous downstream projection.

This module is that journal.  It is deliberately tiny, dependency-free,
and synchronous — an ``fsync`` is the whole point, so there is nothing to
``await``.

Durability model
----------------
* ``record_intent`` appends an ``intent`` record and ``fsync``s before
  returning.  This is the line that MUST be on stable storage before the
  CLOB call.
* ``record_result`` appends a ``result`` record after the wire.  Losing a
  result record is safe: replay simply re-reconciles the orphaned intent
  against the venue by its deterministic key.
* On startup ``load`` rebuilds the in-memory index and ``open_intents``
  returns every intent that never saw a matching result — the set the
  reconcile sweep must resolve against the venue.

Concurrency model
-----------------
One fast-worker process owns a disjoint set of traders (lane-based
ownership), and within that process the per-trader ``asyncio.Lock`` in
``fast_submit`` serialises intent recording for a given signal.  The
journal therefore only needs to protect its own append+index mutation
against interleaving, which a ``threading.Lock`` provides (``fsync``
drops the GIL).  Cross-process dedup for the *same* trader is out of
scope by design — two processes owning one trader is not a supported
topology.
