"""Regression test for the trailing-stop anchor bug.

Production incident 2026-05-20: order ``1ada192f8d594ace86c7138a7177421c``
opened at entry_price=$0.925, price dipped to $0.565 (39% drawdown),
then drifted back up before resolution.  Position held to resolution
and lost the full $10.05 — the trailing stop (12% from high) never
fired.

Root cause: the live/shadow lifecycle's ``reconcile_*_positions``
initialized ``highest_price`` from the first observed mark instead of
``entry_price``.  Because the first mark happened AFTER the dip, the
trailing-stop anchor became $0.565 — the same as the current price —
and the 12% drop check never tripped.

This test pins the strategy's ``should_exit`` semantics against the
fixed lifecycle state shape: when the position is bought at $0.925
and the current price reaches $0.565, the trailing stop MUST fire
"close" because the drop from the (anchored) high is 38.9% — well
above the 12% threshold.

If the lifecycle ever stops anchoring highest_price to entry_price
again, the second-stage tail-end-carry positions will silently bleed
through trailing-stop signals during early drawdowns.  This test
guards that.
