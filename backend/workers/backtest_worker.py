"""Worker loop that drains queued ``BacktestRun`` rows.

Lives on the always-on ``jobs`` plane alongside the other operator
job-queue drainers (provider import, strategy reverse-engineer, Cox
trainer).  Crucially NOT on the trading plane — backtests are
CPU-heavy (1M-snapshot replays chew GIL for minutes) and cannot be
allowed to block the live orchestrator.  Running them in this
dedicated worker process is the "backtest can never fuck the
orchestrator" guarantee.  The plane is spawned below-normal CPU
priority: batch compute yields to the live planes and the user's
foreground.

Polls the queue every ``HOMERUN_BACKTEST_POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS``
(default 3s) and runs at most one job at a time per worker process.
That's deliberate: each backtest already saturates a single core
inside the engine's matching loop, and the DB write path on
completion bursts hard for a few hundred ms.  Running multiple in
parallel on one process would just contend.

To scale up, run multiple discovery-plane processes — each one polls
independently and the ``FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`` claim makes them
mutually exclusive.
