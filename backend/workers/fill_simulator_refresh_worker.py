"""Keep the fill-simulator caches warm.

The order hot path reads measured latency (from
``services/execution_latency_metrics.py`` rolling window),
empirical constants (from ``services/fill_simulator/empirical_
constants.py`` derived from the canonical book-delta parquet), and the active
Cox model (from ``services/fill_simulator/cox_inference.py``).  All
three are cached in process; this worker refreshes them on a
background loop so the hot path never has to wait on a DB query.

Lives on the trading plane because all reads come from there.
Cheap loop: a few SELECTs + one in-process snapshot every 60 s.
